# XKB keyboard layout for X11 - Algeria
XKB keyboard layout for X11 - Algeria

I'm working on an alternative standardised layout of the dz xkb for GNU/Linux based on the freedesktop package, mainly `/usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/dz` and `/usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/*`

Note : Please don't use this work in production situation. It is a work in progress.

Main changes :

- Introducing ɛ Ɛ γ Γ alphabetic letters and commonly used Unicode symbols
- Getting rid off extra characters such as egrave, apostrophe, agrave, ccedilla and so on : éèùàç'
